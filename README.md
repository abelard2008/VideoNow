See my post about this repository here: https://terranjendro.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/aws-mysql-tableau-visualizations/

In this repository, I have compiled the 2 main files that make up the data for my visualizations in Tableau:

1. sakila-schema.sql
2. sakila-data.sql

Download these here or from the MySQL website here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/.

Once those are downloaded and your database is filled, point Tableau to your data source.

You can use the Tableau files provided to see the visualizations and dashboards that I created off of the data.

Thanks!
